##Achieving Required Functionality

To modify the code for the required functionality, I had to first change the start.h file to include the hex numbers for the buttons on the remote I was using.  These values are shown in the table above.  Note, we had to add a button for Zero. Next, I modified the main of the start.h file to toggle the lights depending on if the one button or two button was pressed on the remote.
